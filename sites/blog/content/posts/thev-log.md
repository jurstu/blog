Creating this blog is kind of a fun part for me. Partly I hate it, but partly it's a ready-made solution which requires proper configuration and a reasonable time spent to make it work. It's mildly infuriating until you actually try to deploy it in a reasonable place like github pages. At that point it becomes simply unbearable.

It's exactly like this, but I'm 3780 times more pissed than I should be ðŸ˜….

There were so many commits tonight, that I actually broke my rule and got myself a git-push script..

``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "sync"
git push
```
