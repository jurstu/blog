Creating this blog is kind of a fun part for me. Partly I hate it, but partly it's a ready-made solution which requires proper configuration and a reasonable time spent to make it work. It's mildly infuriating until you actually try to deploy it in a reasonable place like github pages. At that point it becomes simply unbearable.
